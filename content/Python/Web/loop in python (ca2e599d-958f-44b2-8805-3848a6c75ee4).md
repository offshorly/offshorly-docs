# Loop in Python #

Python provides several ways to implement loops. Here's an example of a simple for loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

This code will print numbers from 0 to 4. The `range(5)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4.

Here's an example of a while loop:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

This while loop will also print numbers from 0 to 4. The loop continues as long as the condition `count < 5` is true.

Loops are essential in programming for tasks that require repetition, such as iterating over data structures or performing operations multiple times.
