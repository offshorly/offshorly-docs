# Code Example #

This markdown contains a simple JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates a for loop.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

## Explanation ##

This code does the following:

1. Initializes a loop variable `i` to 0
2. Continues the loop as long as `i` is less than 10
3. Increments `i` by 1 after each iteration
4. Prints the value of `i` to the console in each iteration

The loop will run 10 times, printing the numbers 0 through 9 to the console.
