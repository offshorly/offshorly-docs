# JavaScript Console Log Example #

This markdown demonstrates a simple JavaScript console log statement.

```javascript
console.log("HELLO WORLD!");
```

This code will print "HELLO WORLD!" to the console when executed in a JavaScript environment.

## How It Works ##

1. The `console.log()` function is a built-in JavaScript method used for debugging and logging information.
2. It takes one or more arguments and prints them to the console.
3. In this example, we're passing a single string argument: "HELLO WORLD!".
4. When run, this code will output the text "HELLO WORLD!" to the console, without the quotation marks.

## Usage ##

You can run this code in various JavaScript environments:

- Browser's developer console
- Node.js command line
- Online JavaScript editors (e.g., JSFiddle, CodePen)

This simple example serves as a starting point for more complex logging and debugging tasks in JavaScript development.
